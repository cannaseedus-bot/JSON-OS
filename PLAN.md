# Plan

## To-Do → To-Done

- [x] Create a dedicated `gas/` folder containing all Google Apps Script sources.
- [x] Add installation and deployment instructions for the GAS files.
- [x] Cross-link the GAS deployment flow in the main README.

## Future Plans

- Automate GAS deployments (e.g., via `clasp`) to keep web app URLs in sync.
- Add integration tests that validate GAS responses against the golden hashes.
- Provide a template `server.json` generator that wires GAS routes automatically.
