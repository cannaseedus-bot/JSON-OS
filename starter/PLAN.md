# KUHUL Starter Plan
**Status**: In Progress
**Iteration**: 1

## TODO
- [ ] Initialize Kuhul block catalog (priority: high)
- [ ] Generate a sample CLI projection block (priority: medium)
- [ ] Emit SVG UI container for agent controls (priority: medium)

## COMPLETED
- [x] Scaffold starter directory

## NOTES
- Use `kuhul-es` as the generator runtime when wiring real block emission.
- Keep generated artifacts deterministic for reproducible runs.
